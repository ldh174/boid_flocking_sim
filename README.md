# Boid Flocking Sim with Predator

## Overview
- An interactive flocking simulation built in C++ with SFML, modeling Craig Reynolds’ Boids algorithm with predator–prey dynamics. Agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as separation, alignment, cohesion, and predator avoidance, producing lifelike motion in real time.

## Features
- Real-time simulation of 100+ agents with smooth performance
- Predator–prey interactions that dynamically alter flock behavior
- Custom physics routines (vector math, steering, force limiting)
- Visual polish including alpha blending
